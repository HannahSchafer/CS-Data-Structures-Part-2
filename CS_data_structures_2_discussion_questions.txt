Part 1: Discussion Questions

Recursion:

1.) In your own words, what is recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique or method where a function calls itself
within the definition of the function. It replaces the need for a loop. Also,
every recursive funciton has a base case.


2.) Why is it necessary to have a base case?
Because we need to know when we are done. Otherwise we will get lost in the inception!


Graphs:

1.) What is a graph?
Graphs is a data structure that consists of nodes; the structure shows relationships 
between things; they can be directed or undirected; they can have loops in them 
(i.e. be cyclic OR acyclic); they can be disconnected or connected; and they can have weights.

2.) How is a graph different from a tree?
A tree is a type of graph. A tree can only be connected and acyclic (no loops). 
Trees are mostly directed, whereas a graph is much broader in its criteria. A graph
can by cyclic, be undirected, and be unconnected.

3.) Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.
Twitter relationships! Some Twitter relationships are recriprocated, others are not,
meaning some relationships in the graph would be cyclic and some would be acyclical.
